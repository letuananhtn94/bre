# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing core services for loan approval system
- Setting up Kafka integration for event-driven architecture
- Implementing workflow and rule engine services

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented core domain entities:
   - Rule
   - Workflow
   - WorkflowStep
   - RuleExecutionLog

2. Implemented repositories:
   - RuleRepository
   - WorkflowRepository
   - RuleExecutionLogRepository

3. Implemented services:
   - RuleEngineService
   - WorkflowService
   - KafkaService
   - SchedulerService

4. Implemented controllers:
   - RuleController
   - WorkflowController

5. Implemented Kafka integration:
   - KafkaConfig
   - KafkaService implementation
   - Message models (LoanApprovalRequest, LoanApprovalResult)

6. Implemented scheduling:
   - SchedulerService implementation
   - WorkflowStepJob for Quartz integration

## Active Decisions
1. Using Spring Boot 3.2.3 for the application framework
2. PostgreSQL for data persistence
3. Kafka for event messaging
4. Quartz for scheduling
5. SpEL for rule evaluation
6. REST APIs for service interaction

## Current Considerations
1. Need to implement:
   - Rule validation and testing
   - Workflow versioning
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Monitoring and metrics
   - Security and authentication

2. Technical decisions to be made:
   - Rule caching strategy
   - Workflow state management
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - Performance optimization

## Next Steps
1. Implement rule validation and testing
2. Add workflow versioning support
3. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
4. Add monitoring and metrics
5. Implement security and authentication
6. Add comprehensive logging
7. Create integration tests
8. Set up CI/CD pipeline
